# PacMen-Animation

<h1>This project is a work in progress titled - Pacmen Animation.</h1>

<b>
<p>This project detects pacmen using the .png files as they move in random directions and collide with the bounds of your screen. There are two buttons that start the game, which will initialize movement of the Pacmen, and one that adds additional Pacmen to the screen, each moving in a random direction.

To run this program, open the html file in your local machine, add Pacmen, then click start game.</p>

<h2>Roadmap:</h2>
<p>Update the pac men to animate the opening and closing of their mouth at a set time interval
Change the physical direction of the pac men on screen bound collision in the x axis
